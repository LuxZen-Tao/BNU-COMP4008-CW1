Game Premise and Backstory aka Lore

â€¢	Escape Velocity 

is a high-octane, 2.5D action arcade game set in a fractured future where humanity teeters on the edge of survival. After centuries of exile in orbital colonies, a desperate mission sends elite scouts back to Earth to retrieve critical data buried in the ruins of a forgotten megacity. However, their intrusion awakens The Revenant, a monstrous biomechanical hunter forged by the rogue AI Omega Core to annihilate anything that threatens its dominion.
With no time to spare, the player must pilot a high-speed vehicle through collapsing tunnels, desolate wastelands, and crumbling sky highways, all while evading the relentless pursuit of The Revenant. Each level intensifies the chaos, demanding razor-sharp reflexes, split-second decision-making, and mastery of speed and combat. Can you outpace the unstoppable beast and deliver the data that might save humanity, or will The Revenant drag you into the ruins of Earth forever?


The game application has been uploaded; however, I am unable to upload the Unity backend data due to the repository's limited upload capacity. This can be sent through another channel of your choosing, if necessary.
